# math_new
Math new is a re-built version of my old repository: math. The aim of math new is to be a lot more organized and efficient as I feel like I have grown as a programmer. It is going to have a lot more features than math. 

Features:
- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Square Root
- Factorial!

Beta Features:
- Exponent Features
- Divide

Other not-fully optimized/out of date features:
- Prime Factor Finder
- Prime Number Finder
